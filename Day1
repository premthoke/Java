1- Java - Java is platform independent because Java code runs on the JVM, not directly on hardware. It is object-oriented, which helps in organizing large programs. java is case sensitive 

2- structure of java program

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Java");
    }
}

3- variables & data types
int a = 12;
char name = 'A';
String = "prem thoke";
float per = 72.11f; 
double per = 72.11;

Variable name must start with letter
= means assignment
Java is case-sensitive

4- printing 
int a = 2;
int b= 26;
System.out.println(a+b);
System.out.println("Sum=" + (a + b));

5 - example
int x=10;
if(x>5){
System.out.println("greater than 5");
}

6- Task1 - write a program that stores your name and age and display it
String name = "prem";
int age = 20;
System.out.println("my name is"+name);
System.out.println("my age is"+age);
  
  Task2 - wap that takes a two numbers and display its sum,difference,product
int a=2;
int b=3;
System.out.println("sum = "+(a+b));
System.out.println("difference = "+(a-b));
System.out.println("product = "+(a*b));

  Task3 - did not understand the task  Print:  5 + 3 = 8
int a = 5;
int b = 3;
System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + (a + b));
